--- Introduction ---

Thank you for downloading Contra!

Contra was designed to be easy to use, and therefore it had to
be easy to get working. I have done everything I feel is needed
to make setting up this bot easy. I hope you enjoy using Contra,
and don't find using it too difficult!

If you do find it difficult to get this bot working, then you
probably shouldn't be using a bot at all. Setting up a bot
requires that you know how to use a computer, and common sense.
If you're reading this file, then you're off to a good start.

Modules are relatively easy to make for Contra, but it does
require that you know some PHP. Contra doesn't come with many
pre-installed, but I don't really have the time to be making
modules. If you want to try making some, please read the example
module which can be found in ~/plugins/extensions/OFF. There are
also some extra modules for you to play with in that folder.
Moving them to ~/plugins/extensions will allow you to use them
while the bot is running.

Have fun with Contra, and use your bot responsibly, whichever
core you end up using.

--- PHP ---

Note: This bot was created and tested using PHP 5.2.6.

To find out how to set up PHP on visit this website:

	http://botdom.com/documentation/Install_PHP

--- Bot Setup ---

WINDOWS:

	1. Open the file "phpbin" in a text editor of your choosing.
	2. Edit the file to point to your PHP executable (php.exe).
		| If your php.exe file is located in C:\my\folder, then you
		| would have to put C:\my\folder\php.exe in phpbin.
	3. Run ~/RUN-Contra.cmd and follow the instructions.
		| Depending on your computer's settings, the file extension
	    | may not be known. In which case, run ~/RUN-Contra.

OTHER:

	1. Run ~/RUN-Contra.command and follow the instructions

	
--- Extra ---

Running the other files ending with .command and.cmd
will allow you to do different things. Running
Config.cmd will allow you to configure the bot
and running Menu.cmd will bring up a menu of options.

Contra now has a debug mode which you can run from
RUN-Contra_DEBUG.(cmd/command). it can also be launched
through the main menu.

For more documentation, you can visit the docs on the
wiki at http://botdom.com/documentation/Contra, and check
out the folder ~/storage/docs in this bot while you're
at it!

There are two extra modules in the folder ~/plugins/extensions/OFF.
One of these modules is the example module, the other a module
providing some very simple games for your bot. To use the modules
move them into the folder ~/plugins/extensions. Modules will not
be loaded when inside the "OFF" folder, hence the name "OFF".
